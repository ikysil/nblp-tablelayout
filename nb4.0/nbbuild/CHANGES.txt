version 3
======================
1. removed apisupport modules that were added in version 2.  The patches have since been merged into
the official sources.

2. updated netbeans module definitions

3. merged changes to projectized.xml


version 2
======================
1. added modules for working with harness from within netbeans:
    utilities/group
    apisupport
    apisupport/lite
    apisupport/project

Note: the first 3 are basically just copies from the netbeans source tree, and are only included here because they don't appear on the Update Center.  apisupport/project is modified to work with this harness instead of the setup in the official netbeans source tree.  apisupport/ant should be obtained from the update center.

2. removed dependency on NETBEANS_HOME environment variable.  It's now specified as the netbeans.dest.dir property in user.build.properties (or site.build.properties)

3. removed bootstrap target.  I now just include the nbantext.jar generated by the current netbeans source tree.

4. fixed a few minor bugs
